Rubric:
15pts | Setting Up Server
5pts  | Deciding between Python and Flask or PHP and other connecting software
20pts | Researching Python, Understanding Python, Understand SQL

Compilable Task: You can see my server setup and I can explain what I have learned about it so far and see my notes.

Short Report:
This challenge went well and personally, I did not run in to too many issues. Many of my problems came setting up the server as it was not
as straightforward as I would have liked. However I still had fun, and enjoyed learning something completely foreign to me. The problems I
can see for the future is that there is still a lot to learn. Flask is going to prove to be an issue and creating the backend in python is
going to be another obstacle to overcome. I look forward to it but I dont think I can finish all this in one week, but they are longterm
goals.

Future Week Goals:
Continue to learn SQL
Set up the SQL Server with some mock data
Create backend in Python3
Learn Flask
Eventually link the username and password page to server and start storing account data
