Short Report:
  This week I dedicated my time to learning the different languages
  we are going to be using. I enjoyed learning the things about 
  different coding languages so I enjoyed this challenge. I am
  unsure about the compilable task though as I haven't learned
  enough SQL to submit anything benefitial to the project yet.
  I found that Python was simple to learn as it seems to be a
  more coder-friendly version of C++. SQL is a bit tougher though
  and I am having to dedicate much more time to learning it. My
  rubric is sort of lackluster because I came into the challenge
  with little to no knowledge of either Python or SQL so I decided
  to base the rubric off the learning of each language as well as
  group meetings.
