Short Report:
I thought this challenge went well as a whole; however, I was unsure on somethings.
First, I like how the challenge prepares us for what we will have to turn in for
the final report. I also like that is kind of forces us to meet up and work on the
project and not procrastinate. I really did not understand how the rubric worked.
I knew we had to make it out of 40 points however I did not know if we had to make
a rubric for stuff we still have to accomplish. Additionally, I was glad we got to 
work on the project during lab time. I got a chance to ask the TA's for help and 
they gave me tips on what software to use for our project.
